Running test cases in this directory
------------------------------------

runtest.bat is included for compiling and running tests.

Usage:	runtest cl|gcc testname

	"cl" 		calls the VC++ cl compiler/linker
	"gcc"		calls the GNU gcc compiler/linker
	"testname"	is the name of the C source file without the .c

Tests written in this test suite should behave in the following manner:

	* If a test fails, leave main() with a result of 1.

	* If a test succeeds, leave main() with a result of 0.

	* No diagnostic output should appear when the test is succeeding.
	  Diagnostic output may be emitted if something in the test
	  fails, to help determine the cause of the test failure.
