# HFOsTrack: An interactive GUI for reliable detection and brain mapping of High-Frequency Oscillations (HFOs) features in epilepsy
In the neurological field, most clinicians are not deeply familiar with signal and image processing, artificial intelligence, or programming skills. Therefore, simplifying and integrating various existing algorithms into user-friendly graphical interfaces can be highly beneficial for them in this regard. Recently, High-Frequency Oscillations (HFOs) have emerged as key biomarkers in epilepsy research and diagnosis. The presented software is a plug-and-play interactive Graphical User Interface (GUI) designed for detecting and tracking the underlying mechanisms of HFOs biomarkers. It incorporates six validated HFO detection methods followed by reduction of false detection rates. It also offers new brain mapping capabilities to monitor HFO characteristics across different brain regions and clinical stages. This tool helps bridge the gap between research and clinical practice, enhancing the understanding of clinical relevance and applicability of HFOs in epilepsy.
